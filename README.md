Features
---------
This texture pack adds food icons to tooltips, representing the food value of each item.  
It works similar to what AppleSkin does with item tooltips.

Supported languages
----------------------
- en_us
- es_ar
- es_cl
- es_es
- es_mx
- fr_fr
- it_it
- pt_br

<sub>I'll add more translations over time. You can open an issue asking for a specific language.</sub>

Supported mods
-----------------
- Artifacts
- Oh The Biomes You'll Go
- Galosphere
- Naturalist
- Supplementaries

<sub>Some mods don't have proper translations for all languages. You can find all missing translations in "missing_translations.json".</sub>

Obs.
-----
I had to tweak the food icon because of the text shadow minecraft has by default. It's not perfect, but you'll get used to it very quickly.
