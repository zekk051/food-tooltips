Features
---------
I've been using this texture pack for almost 2 years now and decided to make it public.  
This texture pack adds food icons to tooltips, representing the food value of each item.  
It works similar to what AppleSkin does with item tooltips.

Obs.
-----
I had to tweak the food icon because of the text shadow minecraft has by default. It's not perfect, but you'll get used to it very quickly.
