Features
---------
I've been using this texture pack for almost 2 years now and decided to make it public.  
This texture pack adds food icons to tooltips, representing the food value of each item.  
It works similar to what AppleSkin does with item tooltips.

Supported languages
----------------------
38 languages are already supported! You can check all of them in the "supported.json" file.  
I'll add more translations over time. You can open an issue asking for a specific language/mod to be supported.

Supported mods
-----------------
- Artifacts
- Oh The Biomes You'll Go
- Farmer's Delight
- Galosphere
- Naturalist
- Supplementaries

<sub>Some mods have incomplete/outdated or don't even have translations for all languages.</sub>

Obs.
-----
I had to tweak the food icon because of the text shadow minecraft has by default. It's not perfect, but you'll get used to it very quickly.
