Features
---------
I've been using this texture pack for almost 2 years now and decided to make it public.  
This texture pack adds food icons to tooltips, representing the food value of each item.  
It works similar to what AppleSkin does with item tooltips.

Supported languages
----------------------
80 languages are already supported! You can check all of them in the "supported.json" file.  
I'll add more translations over time. You can open an issue asking for a specific language/mod to be supported.

Supported mods
-----------------
- Alex's Mobs
- Alex's Delight
- Artifacts
- Better End

<sub>Some mods have incomplete/outdated or don't even have translations for all languages.</sub>

Obs.
-----
- Cultural Delights mod has variations between forge and fabric versions. More specifically, the "Elote" restores 3.5 points of food, while in the Fabric version of the mod it restores only 3 points of food. The Forge version is used by default, but you can remove the files and use the ones inside "fabric-lang" folder.

- I had to tweak the food icon because of the text shadow minecraft has by default. It's not perfect, but you'll get used to it very quickly.
